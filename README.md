# Starwars API

This is a simple Javascript REST API that provides fictitious data from elements of the Starwars universe, such as people, spaceships, planets, and vehicles.

> This application was inspired by the following web star wars api: https://swapi.co/

## Getting started
##### In your prefer local path:
- `git clone https://github.com/wallacesat/Starwars-api-heroku`
- `cd Starwars-api-heroku`
- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`
> If you prefer, use `npm` instead of `yarn`

After the server starts successfully, you can make requests to the end points of this api.

##### You will need a rest tool to make GET requests.
> I recommend the  [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download/).

##### GET request example:
Request
- `http://localhost:3001/api/people`
